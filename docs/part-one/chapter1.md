# Chapter 1: Introduction to Distributed Systems

## Overview

Distributed systems are collections of independent computers that appear to users as a single coherent system. Understanding distributed systems is fundamental to grasping why CRDTs are necessary and how they solve critical problems.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Distributed System?

A distributed system consists of multiple autonomous computers that communicate through a computer network and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.

### Challenges in Distributed Systems

1. **Network Partitions**: Communication failures between nodes
2. **Node Failures**: Individual nodes can crash or become unavailable
3. **Clock Synchronization**: Different nodes may have different notions of time
4. **Concurrent Updates**: Multiple nodes updating the same data simultaneously
5. **Consistency**: Ensuring all nodes eventually see the same data

### The CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem states that it's impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of three guarantees:

- **Consistency (C)**: All nodes see the same data at the same time
- **Availability (A)**: Every request receives a response
- **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate despite network partitions

## Why CRDTs Matter

CRDTs provide a way to achieve eventual consistency while maintaining high availability, making them ideal for distributed systems where immediate consistency can be sacrificed for better performance and fault tolerance.

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we'll explore different consistency models and how they relate to CRDTs.
