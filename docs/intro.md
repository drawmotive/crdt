# CRDT: Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types

## Introduction

Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are data structures that can be replicated across multiple nodes in a distributed system and updated independently without coordination, while ensuring eventual consistency and conflict resolution.

## What are CRDTs?

CRDTs are designed to handle the challenges of distributed systems where:
- Multiple replicas can be updated concurrently
- Network partitions can occur
- Immediate consistency is not required
- Eventual consistency is acceptable

## Key Properties

- **Eventual Consistency**: All replicas will eventually converge to the same state
- **Conflict Resolution**: Conflicts are resolved automatically without manual intervention
- **Availability**: Operations can proceed even during network partitions
- **Scalability**: Performance doesn't degrade with the number of replicas

## Common CRDT Types

- **Counters**: Monotonic counters that only increase
- **Sets**: Add-wins or remove-wins sets
- **Maps**: Nested key-value structures
- **Text**: Collaborative text editing with operational transformation
- **Registers**: Last-writer-wins values

## Use Cases

- Collaborative editing applications
- Distributed databases
- Real-time synchronization
- Offline-first applications
- Multi-player games
- IoT device coordination
